# EDA-on-Titanic_Dataset
🚢 Project: Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🚢

Overview:
I recently completed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, aiming to uncover insights and patterns within the data. The Titanic dataset is a classic in the field of data science, and this project allowed me to showcase my analytical and visualization skills.

Key Highlights:
📊 Conducted comprehensive data exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
🔍 Performed data cleaning and handled missing values to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
📈 Created insightful visualizations using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent key trends and relationships in the data.
📉 Investigated factors affecting survival rates among passengers.
🤖 Implemented statistical analysis to extract meaningful conclusions from the dataset.

Tools and Technologies:
🐍 Python: Pandas, NumPy
📊 Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
📈 Statistical Analysis: SciPy

Outcome:
The project culminated in a comprehensive report highlighting key findings and insights obtained through the EDA process. This project not only honed my data analysis skills but also improved my ability to communicate complex findings in a clear and concise manner.

I'm open to feedback and would love to discuss the methodologies and insights gained during this analysis. Feel free to connect and let's discuss the fascinating world of data!
